 *
 * UDP Torrenting Client/Server
 *
 *****************
 * FILES:
 *
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process
 *          
 *
 *
 * src/myclient.c - client source code that takes input to downlad a file from a server
 *
 * src/myserver.c - server source code that takes a requested file and sends back
 *                  the number of bytes of the file that were requested
 *
 * README - This file
 * 
 *
 * doc/Documentation.pdf - Describes the design of the project, 
 *                         including specification of protocol.
 *
 * clientBin/server-info.txt - server info file.
 *
 * serverBin/1mb.txt - 1mb test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * serverBin/tempFile.txt -  test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * serverBin/xs.txt - test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * serverBin/m.txt - test file that worked in my testing
 *
 *
 * serverBin/large.txt - test file that worked in my testing
 *
 *
 *  FEATURES:
 *
 *      1. Concurrent clients and servers are supported.
 *     
 *      2. If even 1 data packet fails from a server, new servers 
 *         are gotten. This means if every server has some percentage
 *         of failure, my program will not download the file.
 *
 *      3. maximum file name is 1000 chars. Up to 1mb file sizes have
 *         been tested.
 * 
 *      4. This program worked locally. I had major issues running
 *         it correctly on the timeshare via SSH. I discovered this 1.5hr before
 *         the deadline
 * 
 *      5. When running the server, use the "e" flag to enable the exiting of the child process
 *         after a connection has been established to simulating a bad
 *         server. Every child process that connects to this server will bee
 *         killed.
