 * Remote Shell Application
 *
 * This application is a remote shell program
 * consisting of a client that takes user input,
 * sends input to the server, and receives a
 * response to display to the user.
 * The server receives the user command,
 * executes the command line command, and sends
 * the result back to the client.
 *
 *****************
 * FILES:
 *
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process
 *
 *
 * src/myclient.c - client source code that takes input and displays output
 *
 * src/myserver.c - server source code that takes client input, and generates
 *                   and sends output to a client
 *
 * README - This file
 *
 *
 * doc/Documentation.pdf - Describes the design of the project, 
 *                         including specification of protocol.
 *
 *
 *
 * bin/test.py - test python program that will test the client and server, ensure they work, 
 *                and quit the processes
 *               - In bin/ simply type "python test.py" to run 
 *               - pexpect is needed to run properly
 *
 *
 *
 *  FEATURES:
 *      1. Infinite output is supported. Infinite input is not. 
 *      2. The client displays the prompt an extra line below the previous
 *         line. This was a purposeful design choice I made.
 *      3. The server catches CTRL+c and asks the user if they really want to quit
 *
