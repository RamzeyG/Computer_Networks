 * Basic P2P Download Program
 *
 * This program is a basic downlaoder program. That
 * downlads a file from multiple servers in chuncks
 * based on an even division of the file size
 *****************
 * FILES:
 *
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process
 *
 *
 *
 * src/myclient.c - client source code that takes input to downlad a file from a server
 *
 * src/myserver.c - server source code that takes a requested file and sends back
 *                  the number of bytes of the file that were requested
 *
 * README - This file
 *
 *
 * doc/Documentation.pdf - Describes the design of the project, 
 *                         including specification of protocol.
 *
 * bin/server-info.txt - provided server info file.
 *
 * bin/darth.txt - provided test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * bin/malloc.txt - provided test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * 
 *
 *
 *
 *  FEATURES:
 *      1. The maximum file size that my program supports is 228,000 bytes.
 *
 *      2. Servers that crash after a connection is established are handled
 *         by the client. But servers that crash mid-downlad is not.
 *
 *      3. The program works just fine with manually created text files, if
 *         errors are experienced when using a sript, please manually run
 *         this program. I have had weird experience with both provided
 *         testing scripts and text files generated from a sript or command prompt.
 *
 *      4. The new file that is generated by the client is downloaded into a file
 *         name of "newFile.txt". Only text files are supported.
 *
 *      5. The server-info.txt file must have a new line after the last line of
 *         servers and ports due to my implementation of reading in servers
 *         from the file.
 *
 *      6. When finishing a download, the resulting file is called "newFle.txt"
 *         This was implemented to allow the server and client to run in 
 *         the same directory without file naming issues.
 *
 *      7. The file name must not be bigger than 1268 characters
