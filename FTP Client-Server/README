 * a basic FTP Client and server.

 * FILES:
 *
 *
 * Makefile - File used for automating the build process
 *          
 *
 *
 * src/ftpclient.c - client source code that takes input to execute on the ftpserver
 *
 * src/ftpserver.c - server source code that takes a request and sends back a
 *                   message as well as data.

 * README - This file

 *
 * serverBin/1mb.txt - 1mb test file that worked in my testing
 *
 * serverBin/test.txt -  test file that worked in my testing
 *
 *
 *
 *  FEATURES:
 *
 *      1. Normal ls, get, put, quit commands work.
 *
 *     
 *      2. Randomly there are issues where a command does not
 *         execute completely. It was super rare, so I could not
 *         completely test and remove the problem.
